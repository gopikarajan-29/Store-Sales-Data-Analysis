# ðŸ“Š Store Sales Data Analysis
This research offers insights from a retail store's sales statistics together with an exploratory data analysis (EDA).  We find important trends in product sales, category performance, seasonal fluctuation, and customer purchasing behaviour using Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), and Power BI.  My MSc Data Analytics portfolio includes this project, which demonstrates my abilities in dashboarding, data cleansing, and visualization.
